    <p>
        If you would like to get involved with the Jetty project there are a number of ways you can participate.
    </p>

    <h3>Get Involved with the Code</h3>

    <p>
        If rolling up your sleeves and digging into the codebase is interesting, one of the best places to start is at
        the github project <a href="https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project">here</a>. If you are looking for a bit of
        inspiration on what to work on, take a look at the issues for the project where we maintain a <a
                href="https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/labels/Help%20Wanted">Help Wanted</a> tag. The Jetty
        project uses Apache Maven as the <a href="/jetty/develop.php#t-contributing-build">build
            system</a> and there are coding conventions that we would appreciate you following documented <a
                href="/jetty/develop.php#cg-coding-standards">here</a>. Please keep in mind that as
        an Eclipse project there is a bit more administrative burden required on your part to contribute code,
        information on that can be found <a href="/jetty/contribute.php">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Get Involved in the Documentation</h3>
    <p>
        Jetty documentation is maintained <a
                href="https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/tree/jetty-10.0.x/jetty-documentation">alongside the
            source</a> but don't let that dissuade you from from contributing to the documentation, it is a great place
        to build commit karma and help the community at large. You'll need to follow the same rules as committing to the
        code which can be read about <a href="/jetty/contribute.php">here.</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Get Involved in the Community</h3>

    <p>
        StackOverflow is an excellent resource for users with questions and helping them out is a great way to get involved. The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jetty">Jetty</a> tag is a great place to start building up that reputation.
    </p>

    <p>Mailing lists are a primary communication channel with the Eclipse Jetty development team.
        If you are interested in getting announcements for new versions, or want to participate in discussions of
        development or integration topics, you can subscribe to one of the following mailing lists.
        You may also track svn commits for the Jetty project.</p>
